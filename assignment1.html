    <section>
    <p>The Department of Anthropology in Yangon University was established in 1950, in Judson Hall. Its location
         on the campus has moved over the year: first, to the Social Science building, then in 1964 to Taungoo Hall 
        Since 1983 the Anthropology Department has been located in Yamanya Hall. The Department started small, with few staaff and students but then expanded to include Sociology
         and even International Relations for a few years unitl Anthropology was reduced to a minor subject status under the new education system in 1964. At that point, the Department shrank in numbers of staff and students,
        until 1982 when Anthropology was restore to major subject again. In the early year of the Department, several oversea academics supported the teaching of Anthropology, Sociology and International Relations in Yangon, while several Myanmar academics
        futhered their studies in the USA and the UK. Nowadays the Department is staffed by Myanmar academics.<br>
